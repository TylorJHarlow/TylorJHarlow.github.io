In this talk I reviewed preliminary results on phase-specific acoustic stimulation of individualized alpha peak frequencies using the end-point corrected hilbert transform. Relevent analytics includes component-specific changes in the ERP, evoked and induced alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations, and resulting phase-amplitude coupling at variable time scales.
