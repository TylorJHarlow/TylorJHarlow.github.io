permalink: /publication/Phase-dependent modulation of frontal alpha and gamma oscillations with a novel brain computer interface technology.
excerpt: 'This paper focuses electrophysiological responses to phase-specific stimulation of individualized alpha peak frequencies.  Analyses include component specifc changes of the ERP, as well as in eovked and induced alpha oscillations and resulting phase-amplitude coupling to gamma waves.'
