I am a third year PhD student studying at the University of Connecticut working with Dr. James Chrobak and Dr. Heather Read. My research interests include signal processing and electrophysiology, and the applications of meta-analytic research methods to this area of research. Through the use large scale syntheses, I hope to provide insight into the system-level dynamics that underly the intersection between sensory perception and memory.
