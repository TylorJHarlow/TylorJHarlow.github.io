Psych 1100 is the first course in a sequence of general psychology courses offered by the University of Connecticut. The lab portion taught by graduate students is an adjacent course taken simultaneously.  It focuses on research methods, science as an institution, and basic statistical concepts. Much of the lecture content, exams, and other course material are developed by graduate students. I taught multiple sessions of this course each semester from 2020 to 2022.
