This is a dual appointment course between the Department of Psychological Sciences and the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Connecticut. This course provides and overview of auditory processing, as well as signal processing through in-house functions in MATLAB. I was a teaching assistant for this course in Spring of 2023, producing MATLAB exercises and aiding in instructional materials.
